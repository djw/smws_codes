SMWS Codes
==========

The [Scotch Malt Whisky Society](http://www.smws.co.uk/) uses a two-part numerical identifier for each of its whiskies, e.g. 29.127. This corresponds to the 127th cask acquired from distillery 29. They have an agreement not to publish the distillers' names, but the mapping is well known.

This repository contains the source code and data for http://danjwilson.co.uk/smws/, an offline, mobile webapp for looking up this mapping.
